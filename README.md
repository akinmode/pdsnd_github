### Project Title
Us BikeShare Data Exploration Project

### Description
The project explores the bikeshare data for three US states (*Chicago*, *New York* and *Washington DC*) by months (first 6 months) and days for the year 2017.

The following statitics are computed:
**1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**#2 Popular stations and trip**
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**#3 Trip duration**
- total travel time
- average travel time

**#4 User info**
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
Project uses the python programming to implement the above statistics as a command line application in the [bikeshare.py](bikeshare.py) file.

Python packages used are [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
